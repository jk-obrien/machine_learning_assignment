Do all the set-up stuff first.

```{r init, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(77412)
library(caret)
options(width=180)
train <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
```

There are many instances of the string "#DIV/0!" and of the empty string "".
Let's treat those as NA.
```{r clean}
train[train==""]        <- NA
train[train=="#DIV/0!"] <- NA
```

Many of the columns are now almost completely filled with NAs. Make a function
to measure this and then a histogram to see how the proportion of NAs is
distributed.
```{r nas}
na_prop <- function(x) sum(is.na(x))/length(x)
nas     <- sapply(train,na_prop)
hist(nas, xlab="Proportion of NA values", main="Histogram of NA Proportions")
```

The histogram shows that the variables are divided into those with 90% or more
NA values, and those with 10% or less - in fact inspection of the latter group
shows that none of them have any NA values. Continue the study using only this
group as predictors, but save the list of column names so we can remove them
from the test set also later on.
```{r slim}
droppedCols <- names(nas[nas>0.9])
train       <- train[names(nas[nas==0])]
```

The first seven variables remaining in `train` are the row numbers, the
particpants' names, and various types of time-stamps and window variables.
Inspection (not shown) of these indicates that most of them will not be of much
value for predition of the `classe` variable. Even if they were, the aim of the
study is to use the motion sensor data for this purpose, so we will try to
achieve this and remove those seven variables also. Again, we add the column
names to our list.
```{r seven}
droppedCols <- c(droppedCols, names(train)[1:7])
train       <- train[-1:-7]
```

Lastly, check the remaining variables for low variance and for high correlations
among themselves.
```{r varCor}
nearZeroVar(train)  # No low variance columns found.

corMat      <- cor(train[-dim(train)[2]])
hiCor       <- findCorrelation(corMat)
droppedCols <- c(droppedCols, names(train)[hiCor])
train       <- train[-hiCor]
```

Have a look at the data that we have left for unusual distributions, skew, etc.
```{r inspect, warning=FALSE}
library(reshape2)
hist_data <- melt(train[,-46])
ggplot(hist_data, aes(x=value)) +
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales="free_x") +
    geom_histogram()
```

There seems to be a lot of skew in some variables (e.g. gryos_dumbbell_y) but as
the random forest approach is not sensitive to skew and as there seem to be no
other obvious problems we will not apply any transformations to the data.

Divide the training set into two - one set for training, and another for cross
validation.
```{r slice}
divInd <- createDataPartition(y=train$classe, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
tset   <- train[ divInd,]
vset   <- train[-divInd,]
```

Now we are ready to carry out the training. We will use random forests.
```{r forest, cache=TRUE}
rfMod <- train(
    y=tset$classe, x=tset[,-46], allowParallel=TRUE, do.trace=TRUE,
    trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
)
rfMod
```

Estimate our out of sample error using cross-validation against the random
subset, `vset`, which we set aside earlier.
```{r validate}
predV   <- predict(rfMod, vset)
correct <- predV==vset$classe
oos     <- 1 - sum(correct)/length(correct)
table(predV, correct)
```

Finally, load the test data, remove the same columns we removed from the
training data, and then make our predictions.

```{r test}
test  <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
test  <- test[ , -which(names(test) %in% droppedCols) ]
predT <- predict(rfMod, test)
```
